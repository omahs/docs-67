# Getting Started with the Installer

The easiest way to install tea is with our installer:

```sh
sh <(curl https://tea.xyz)
```

{% hint style="question" %}
`fish` user? Then you need `sh <(curl https://tea.xyz | psub)` instead.
{% endhint %}

The script installs to `~/.tea` and sets up magic (we ask politely first).

> Linux and WSL2 users may need to install some prerequisites.

## What Happens

* Firstly we confirm you’re cool before we do *anything*
    * If so we install tea to `~/.tea`
    * If not we exit with failure
* We then ask if you want [magic](../magic.md)
    * If so we add one line to your `~/.shellrc`
    * If not we exit successfully

## It’s Not Just an Installer

If you run it again, it’ll update `tea`.

### That’s Not All

The tea one-liner can also be used to provide your users a temporary sandbox
for your projects. They can use the power of tea to try out your project
without installing tea or your project.

## Requirements

Both aarch64 (arm64) and x86-64 for these platforms:

* macOS >= 11
* Linux glibc >=2.28 (consult [repology](https://repology.org/project/glibc/versions))
* WSL >=2

{% hint style="info" %}
`linux-aarch64` builds are done using a dockerized Debian image on Apple arm64
processors. We have tested and confirmed functionality on Raspberry Pi4 running
Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, and it should work on similar 64-bit Pi Foundation hardware
with a sufficient glibc, which should include the last several releases of
Raspbian Linux. 32-bit CPU builds are not being done at this time.
{% endhint %}

We want to support Windows native and after that every platform; yes even
your NAS and IoT devices. We’re going to get the above sorted first though.


### Linux / WSL Caveats

On Linux you may need some pre-requisite packages from your system packager.
This is a temporary situation that we are fixing.

We are keeping a list of pre-reqs in [this script].
